I'm proficient in HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React JS. I am currently enrolled in a 1-year Software developer course with CodeSpace. 

In addition to my technical skills, I possess excellent communication skills that I gained working as an elementary school English teacher. I had to communicate complex grammar in a simplified and easy-to-understand manner. This will enable me to break down complex problems and collaborate effectively with other developers.
